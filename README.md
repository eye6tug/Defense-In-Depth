In today's digital world, where security threats are increasingly rapidly, it is crucial to implement a robust defense strategy.The Defense-in-Depth Security Architecture for Linux Web Applications project implements a multi-layered security strategy to safeguard both infrastructure and applications. This starts with the top layer policy,procedures and awareness which enforces strong password policies to secure user credentials. Perimeter and Internal Network Security is enhanced through the use of TLS certificates, iptables and xtables firewalls, and IDS/IPS systems like Snort to prevent unauthorized access and monitor network traffic. Host Security includes automated package updates, changes to default SSH ports, Fail2Ban protection, SSH access logging, and MFA for SSH to ensure system integrity. Application Security is achieved through effective user authentication, deployment of ModSecurity WAF  with integrated OWASP, hiding Apache header banners. Finally, Data Security is maintained with MariaDB encryption and scheduled daily backups to protect against data loss.

This multi-layered approach delivers comprehensive protection, addressing various security challenges and ensuring both infrastructure and application security.
